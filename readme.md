##History

The g11n project is the daughter of the [JALHoO](http://wiki.joomla-nafu.de/joomla-dokumentation/Benutzer:Elkuku/Proyektz/JALHOO) project. You should read about it if you are interested in why it was created in the first place.

##Installation

The library is installed using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)

```
    "require": {
        "elkuku/g11n": "dev-master"
    }
```

##Custom extensions
The folders ```admin``` and ```site``` contain extensions for the Joomla! CMS to help in language handling (e.g. a language switcher) or to replace the standard Joomla! extensions.
These are currently unmaintained...
