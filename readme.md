##History

The g11n project is the daughter of the [JALHoO](http://wiki.joomla-nafu.de/joomla-dokumentation/Benutzer:Elkuku/Proyektz/JALHOO) project. You should read about it if you are interested in why it was created in the first place.

##Installation

The library can be installed, like any other extension, with the standard Joomla! installer from the CMS backend.

It is also possible to just copy the directory to the libraries folder in the CMS.

##Custom extensions
The folders ```admin``` and ```site``` contain extensions for the Joomla! CMS to help in language handling (e.g. a language switcher) or to replace the standard Joomla! extensions.
